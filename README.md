# NLP_FinalProject_2022
This is my last project for my Natural Language Processing class. In this project i have made my first  ever attempt at understanding and using a multilingual model as well as finding some way to modify or change it whether beneficially or interestingly.

In the end, I could not get the base model to work correctly for me, but regardless this is the function I used while attempting to get mT5 in working order.
